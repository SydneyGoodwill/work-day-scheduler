# Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to display a simple calendar app that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. This app also utilizes the Moment.js library.

# Functioning the App

When the user enters text into a time slot on the calendar and presses 'save', that information will be saved to their local storage - meaning they can refresh the page, and their info will still be there. To delete information from the time slots, simply delete the previous text and press 'save'.
